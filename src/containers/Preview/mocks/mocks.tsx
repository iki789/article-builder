The fire went on to burn nearly 100,000 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</p><p>Biologists from the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area found that bobcat B-362 had relocated to an area of dense vegetation in a large backyard in Westlake Village, a city about 10 miles from Thousand Oaks.

The kittens will stay with their mother until they are between 9 and 11 months old. Then they will gradually become more independent, but still check in with their mother from time to time.</p>`));
